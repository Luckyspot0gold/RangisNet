# AEAS v1.x — Call for Public Comment

**Status:** Draft Standard (v1.x)  
**Comment Period:** Open

The ADA Economic Accessibility Standard (AEAS) is published as a draft to invite public, academic, and institutional review.

AEAS proposes a framework for representing economic reality through multiple sensory channels—without prediction, persuasion, or behavioral manipulation—so that economic state can be perceived across diverse sensory and cognitive profiles.

## We are seeking feedback on:

- Clarity and completeness of definitions
- Practicality of multi-modal requirements
- Non-deceptive translation constraints ("Is Mandate")
- Alignment with accessibility frameworks (ADA, Section 508, WCAG)
- Auditability and transparency requirements
- Edge cases, risks, or unintended consequences

## Who should comment:

- Accessibility professionals
- Economists and market researchers
- Human-computer interaction researchers
- Neurodiversity and cognitive science experts
- Engineers and system designers
- Regulators and policy advisors
- Educators and students

## How to submit comments:

- **GitHub Issues / Discussions:** [https://github.com/Luckyspot0gold/RangisNet/issues](https://github.com/Luckyspot0gold/RangisNet/issues)
- **Email:** justin@realityprotocol.io

### Please reference:

- Section / chapter number
- Specific language or requirement
- Suggested revision or concern
- Rationale (technical, ethical, or practical)

All substantive comments will be logged and reviewed. Revisions will be documented transparently in subsequent drafts.

**AEAS is a public-interest standard. Participation is welcome.**
