---

## 13. RISKS & MITIGATION

### 13.1 Risk: Trade Secret Disclosure

**Threat:** Developer leaks formulas, competitor replicates

**Mitigation:**

- ✅ NDAs for all developers
- ✅ Private repository
- ✅ Code obfuscation in production
- [ ] Watermarking outputs (to implement)
- [ ] Employee/contractor IP assignment agreements

---

### 13.2 Risk: Patent Rejection

**Threat:** USPTO rejects claims as obvious or prior art exists

**Mitigation:**

- [ ] Comprehensive prior art search before filing
- [ ] Hire experienced patent attorney
- [ ] File broad + narrow claims
- [ ] Prepare to amend claims during prosecution

---

### 13.3 Risk: Trademark Conflict

**Threat:** Existing trademark blocks our registration

**Mitigation:**

- [ ] USPTO TESS search before filing
- [ ] Hire trademark attorney for clearance search
- [ ] Have backup names ready
- [ ] Consider purchasing conflicting marks if valuable

---

### 13.4 Risk: Open Source License Violation

**Threat:** Using GPL code without compliance, forced to open-source our IP

**Mitigation:**

- ✅ Audit dependencies for licenses (see package.json)
- ✅ Avoid GPL/AGPL dependencies
- ✅ Use MIT/Apache 2.0 where possible
- [ ] Annual license compliance review

---

## 14. ENFORCEMENT STRATEGY

### 14.1 Monitoring

**Proactive:**

- [ ] Set up Google Alerts for "Rangi's Net", "McCrea Metrics", etc.
- [ ] Monitor GitHub for forks/clones (private repo, but check)
- [ ] USPTO watch service (once trademarks filed)
- [ ] Domain monitoring (MarkMonitor or similar)

---

### 14.2 Response Plan

**If Infringement Detected:**

1. **Document:** Screenshot, archive, timestamp evidence
2. **Analyze:** Confirm actual infringement vs. fair use
3. **Consult:** Attorney review before action
4. **Cease & Desist:** Send formal letter
5. **Negotiate:** Attempt settlement
6. **Litigate:** If necessary (expensive, last resort)

---

### 14.3 Defensive Publications

**Strategy:** Publish non-core innovations to prevent others from patenting them

**Example:** Publish a paper on "General Principles of Financial Sonification" to prevent competitor patents, while keeping specific 432 Hz method + formulas secret

**Timing:** After core patents filed, before competitors enter space

---
