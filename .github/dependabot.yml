# Security-focused configuration
# Dependabot will:
# 1. Check for vulnerabilities weekly
# 2. Create PRs for security updates immediately
# 3. Group non-security updates to reduce PR noise
# 4. Auto-assign you as reviewer
# 5. Label PRs for easy filtering

# After adding this file:
# 1. git add .github/dependabot.yml
# 2. git commit -m "chore: add Dependabot configuration for security updates"
# 3. git push
# 4. Dependabot will start scanning within 24 hours
# 5. Review and merge PRs as they come in
