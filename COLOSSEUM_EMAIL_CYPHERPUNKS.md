Hi Colosseum Team,

I'm Justin McCrea with Reality Protocol (Rangi's Heartbeat). I submitted via the arena dashboard (Sep/Oct 2025) but the status shows "no winners selected" while X mentions announcements at Breakpoint Dec 12. Can you confirm receipt and provide any updates on submission status?

  - 432Hz Harmonic Sonification: H(t)/A(t) for haptic/phonic/cymatic market cognition
