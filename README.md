📄 README.md  — Avalanche X402 Hackathon Edition

# 🌈 RangisNet  
### A Harmonic Execution & Asset Cognition Layer for Avalanche  
**Avalanche X402 Hackathon – December 2025 Submission**

RangisNet transforms Avalanche blockchain activity into **real-time, multi-sensory intelligence** using sound, color, resonance patterns, and harmonic signals.

Instead of charts…  
→ **You can hear volatility**  
→ **You can feel congestion**  
→ **You can see risk as color**  
→ **You can sense network health**

RangisNet is designed for **accessibility, intuition, and next-generation interaction** with Avalanche networks.

## 🧠 What RangisNet Does
RangisNet is a **Harmonic Execution Layer™** and **Asset Cognition Engine** that reads Avalanche network data, interprets it using the **McCrea Market Metrics™**, and outputs a compact, multi-sensory “Rangi Signal.”

RangisNet turns Avalanche blockchain data into:

- 🎧 **Audio Signatures** – tone, pitch, resonance  
- 🌈 **Visual Signatures** – harmonic color spectrum & gradients  
- 📳 **Haptic Signatures** – vibration intensity and cadence  
- 💾 **Sonic Event Codes™** – structured, machine-readable cues  

These signals provide insight into:

- Risk  
- Volatility  
- Network congestion  
- Transaction comfort level  
- Execution health  

All in real time.

## ⚡ Avalanche-Focused Capabilities

RangisNet connects directly to Avalanche:

### **C-Chain Data**
- Gas prices  
- TPS  
- Mempool depth  
- Latency  
- Block health  

### **Subnet Data**
- Validator performance  
- Fee markets  
- Subnet congestion  
- Network health scoring  

### **Economic Data**
(From supported oracles)
- AVAX price  
- Liquidity metrics  
- Volatility indexes  

This is converted into a **Harmonic Fingerprint** and a **Sonic Event Code™**, consumable by wallets, dashboards, games, and accessibility tools.

## 🧬 Core Technologies

### 🟣 **McCrea Market Metrics™ (MMM)**  
A proprietary real-time metric engine that translates Avalanche network state into human-interpretable signals:

- `stability_index`  
- `execution_risk`  
- `comfort_band`  
- `hazard_band`  
- `network_heartbeat`  
- `harmonic_liquidity_score`  
- `harmonic_stability_score`  

These metrics are computed by code located in:

engines/metrics/ McCrea-MetricsEngine.py Harmonic-Liquidity-index.js Harmonic-Stability-index.js Tracks.js

---

### 🔵 **Harmonic Execution Layer™**
A signal translation engine that converts metrics into:
- Frequencies  
- Oscillation patterns  
- Harmonic envelopes  
- Timbre  
- Rangi Resonance Codes  

Located in:

engines/ranginet/ engines/realtime/ websocket/harmonic-stream.js

---

### 🔴 **Sonic Event Codes™**
Standardized message packets that describe network state via harmonic data.

Example output:

```json
{
  "chain": "Avalanche",
  "symbol": "AVAX",
  "stability_index": 0.22,
  "execution_risk": 0.81,
  "harmonics": [432, 466, 512],
  "intensity": 0.9,
  "signal_mode": "alert",
  "rangiSignal": "0x7f3a19..."
}

These codes can:

Trigger UI animations

Play sound

Inform accessibility devices

Power trading dashboards

Generate haptic feedback

🧩 Why This Helps Users

RangisNet enhances:

⭐ Accessibility

Low-vision and visually impaired users can trade using sound and vibration.

⭐ New User Comprehension

No charts required — users “hear” when risk rises.

⭐ Expert Tools

Traders gain a second sensory channel to detect volatility.

⭐ Avalanche Subnet Builders

Can monitor the “heartbeat” and health of their own networks.

⭐ Games & XR

Blockchain activity becomes an environmental audio or feedback force.
