# Reality Protocol: Executive Summary

## The Vision in One Sentence
**Wyoming's physical assets meet global digital markets through multi-sensory AI-optimized interfaces.**

## What We Do

### Physical → Digital Bridge
- **Tokenize Wyoming Assets:**
  - Land & Property ($800K ranch → 800 × $1K tokens)
  - Energy Mining (Wind/Hydro → Bitcoin revenue tokens)
  - Businesses (LLC equity → tradeable tokens)
  - Agriculture (Crop yield → profit-sharing tokens)

- **Multi-Sensory Experience (M3 Metrics):**
  - Hear markets (7-Bell system: 86Hz-1266Hz)
  - See markets (3D cymatics, VR/AR)
  - Feel markets (Haptic feedback)
  - No math, no algorithms—just sensation

- **Accessibility-First:**
  - Blind users: Audio-first interface
  - Deaf users: Visual cymatics
  - Neurodivergent: Customizable sensory profiles
  - AI systems: Harmonic data transfer (10x faster than JSON)
