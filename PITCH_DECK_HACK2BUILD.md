## 📊 SLIDE-BY-SLIDE BREAKDOWN

### **SLIDE 1: TITLE** (10 seconds)

**Layout:** Title only, centered, bold background

**Content:**
```
🎵 RangisNet

```

**Visuals:**
- Background: Gradient (purple → cyan → black)
- Logo: Reality Protocol (if available)
- Subtitle: "432Hz Harmonic Cognition™"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Hi, I'm Justin McCrea. This is RangisNet—the world's first patent-backed multi-sensory AI agent that makes crypto markets feel intuitive through sound, touch, and visualization."

### **SLIDE 2: PROBLEM** (20 seconds)

**Layout:** Split screen - left text, right image/stats

**Content:**
```
THE PROBLEM: Markets Are Invisible

📊 Traditional Trading:
  - Charts & spreadsheets
  - Visual-only interfaces
  - High cognitive load
  - Excludes 2.7B people

🚫 Who We Exclude:
  - 285M blind users
  - 430M deaf users
  - 2B neurodivergent (autism, ADHD, dyslexia)
  - 8.8B humans deserve better

❌ Result: <1% crypto adoption
```

**Visuals:**
- Left: Text with emojis
- Right: Infographic showing excluded populations
- Bottom: "97% of humans don't use crypto—why?"

**Speaker Notes:**
"The problem? Crypto markets are invisible. Spreadsheets exclude 2.7 billion people—blind, deaf, neurodivergent. If you can't see charts or read numbers fast, you're locked out. We're solving that."

### **SLIDE 3: SOLUTION - PATENT** (30 seconds)

**Layout:** Center focus with patent details

**Content:**
```
THE SOLUTION: Multi-Sensory Cognition

🎵 PATENT-PENDING IP (Reality Protocol LLC)
   EIN: 39-3754298 | Filed 2024

H(t) = Harmonic Function (432Hz baseline)
A(t) = Amplitude (volume-based intensity)
V(θ,φ) = Visual Spinor (spherical coordinates)

🔊 HEAR IT: 7-Bell System (86Hz - 1266Hz)
   - Bell frequency = market state
   - Pitch shifts = price momentum

👋 FEEL IT: Haptic Feedback (W3C Vibration API)
   - Intensity = volatility
   - Pulse rate = volume

👁️ SEE IT: 3D Spinor + Cymatics
   - Spherical geometry
   - VR-ready visualization
```

**Visuals:**
- Center: Patent formula (H(t), A(t), V(θ,φ))
- Icons: Speaker (audio), Hand (haptic), Eye (visual)
- Bottom: "Patent-backed IP = Competitive moat"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our patent-backed solution? Multi-sensory cognition. Harmonic sonification at 432Hz—you hear price movements as tones. Haptic feedback—you feel volatility as vibrations. 3D Spinor—you see markets as spherical geometry. This is how 2 billion people will finally understand crypto."
