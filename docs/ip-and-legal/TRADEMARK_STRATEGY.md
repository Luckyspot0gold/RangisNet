## 6. TRADEMARK DESIGN ELEMENTS

### Logo Considerations

**Current Status:** Text-only marks (RANGI'S NET, McCREA METRICS)

**Future Logo Registration:**

If you create a stylized logo, register separately as:

1. **Word Mark** — Text only (protects any presentation)
2. **Design Mark** — Logo with specific design (protects visual appearance)
3. **Composite Mark** — Both together (strongest protection)

**Cost Consideration:**

Each variation = separate filing fee. Start with word marks (most flexible protection).

### Tagline Opportunities

Consider trademarking taglines:

- "Feel the Market™"
- "Multi-Sensory Finance™"
- "Cognition Beyond Vision™"

*(Lower priority, file after core marks secured)*

---

## 7. ENFORCEMENT & MONITORING

### Watch Services

Once registered, monitor for infringement:

- **USPTO Watch Service** — $150/year per mark
- **Google Alerts** — Free, monitors web usage
- **Domain Monitoring** — Track similar domain registrations

### Enforcement Actions

If infringement detected:

1. **Cease & Desist Letter** — Attorney sends warning ($500-1000)
2. **Negotiation** — Attempt settlement
3. **UDRP (Domains)** — Recover infringing domains ($1500-3000)
4. **Litigation** — Last resort (expensive, $50k+)

## 8. MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS

### USPTO Maintenance Timeline
