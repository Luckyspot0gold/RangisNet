## 📝 SCRIPT BREAKDOWN

### **INTRO (30 SECONDS)** [0:00-0:30]

**[Screen: rangis.net homepage]**

> "Hi, I'm Justin McCrea from Reality Protocol. This is **RangisNet**—the world's first **patent-backed Layer 1.5 agent** that makes crypto markets **feel intuitive** through multi-sensory feedback.
>
> While everyone else builds charts and spreadsheets, we built a system that 2 billion neurodivergent people can **hear, feel, and see**—using 432Hz harmonic sonification, haptic feedback, and 3D visualization.
>
> Watch how Rangi, our AI agent, negotiates an AVAX trade using Avalanche x402 micropayments and ICM cross-chain messaging."

**[Show quick flash of features:]**
- Patent notice: "432Hz Harmonic Cognition™"
- User count: "2B+ addressable market"
- Tech stack: "Avalanche x402 + ICM + Teleporter"

---

### **DEMO (1 MINUTE 30 SECONDS)** [0:30-2:00]

**[Screen: Navigate to rangis.net/heartbeat]**

**Step 1: Select AVAX** (10 seconds) [0:30-0:40]
> "First, I select AVAX from our market dropdown. Watch the **7-Bell Harmonic System** activate."

**[Show:]**
- Dropdown selection: AVAX
- Real-time price: $40.50
- Bell 4 activates (432Hz - Neutral market state)

---

**Step 2: Haptic Pulse** (15 seconds) [0:40-0:55]
> "Notice the **haptic pulse**—my phone vibrates at intensity matched to market volatility. Low volatility = gentle pulses. High volatility = intense vibration. This is patent-pending **haptic cognition** for blind traders and neurodivergent users."

**[Show on mobile device:]**
- Hand holding phone
- Visible vibration effect
- Text overlay: "Haptic Intensity: 35% (Low volatility)"

---

**Step 3: x402 Micropayment** (20 seconds) [0:55-1:15]
> "Now I connect my wallet and initiate a micro-trade using **Avalanche x402 micropayments**. Rangi negotiates the best price in real-time—sub-millisecond PTE calculations predict market moves before they happen."

**[Show:]**
- Wallet connect modal (Thirdweb)
- "Negotiate AVAX?" button click
- x402 payment confirmation: "0.0001 AVAX fee"
- Transaction hash appears
- Text overlay: "x402 Micropayment: $0.004 fee (vs $0.50 traditional)"

---

**Step 4: Phonic Tone** (15 seconds) [1:15-1:30]
> "Listen to that tone—**432Hz**, the frequency of market equilibrium. As price moves, the pitch shifts across our 7-Bell system. Green Bell 6 (512Hz) means bull market. Red Bell 2 (256Hz) means bear market. This is **audio-based market cognition**."

**[Show:]**
- Audio visualization (waveform)
- Frequency meter: "432Hz → 486Hz (Bell 5 - Mild bull)"
- Price chart moving up
- Text overlay: "7-Bell System: Patent-Pending Audio Cognition"

---

**Step 5: 3D Spinor + Cymatics** (20 seconds) [1:30-1:50]
> "And here's our **Immaculate Spinor**—a 3D sphere showing market geometry in real-time. Horizontal circles show +/- price zones. Vertical meridians track volume and Fear & Greed Index. The needle points outward based on price momentum. This is **VR-ready market visualization**."

**[Show:]**
- 3D Spinor rotating
- Needle moving based on price change
- Horizontal circles: +20%, +10%, 0%, -10%, -20%
- Vertical meridians with volume markers
- Text overlay: "Spherical Coordinates: Theta (F&G), Phi (Volume)"

---

**Step 6: ICM Warp** (10 seconds) [1:50-2:00]
> "Finally, watch as Rangi uses **Avalanche ICM** to warp this transaction to Solana—true cross-chain sensory trading. One interface, multiple chains."

**[Show:]**
- "Warp to Solana?" button
- ICM transaction confirmation
- Cross-chain bridge animation
- Text overlay: "ICM + Teleporter: Avalanche ↔ Solana"

---

### **CLOSE (30 SECONDS)** [2:00-2:30]

**[Screen: Back to homepage or Rangi Detective dashboard]**

> "That's RangisNet. For the **2 billion people** who struggle with spreadsheets, we make crypto markets **feel like music, touch like rhythm, and look like art**.
>
> We're applying for the **AI Agents track**—$10K prize. Our patent-backed IP, live MVP, and real-world traction with accessibility organizations prove this works.
>
> Rangi the Truth Detective is already exposing market manipulation through multi-sensory analysis. Imagine what we'll build next with Avalanche Subnets and x402 at scale.
>
> **Feel confident. Trade intuitively. This is the future.**
>
> Visit **rangis.net** to try it yourself. Thank you!"

- Smooth transitions (no jerky movements)
- Show full flow (don't skip steps)
- Highlight key UI elements

### **Mobile Demo:**
- Use screen mirroring (AirPlay/Chromecast) for haptic demo
- Or use external camera to show phone vibrating
- Keep phone stable (tripod or stand)

### **Backup Plan:**
- Record multiple takes (pick best)
- If rangis.net is down, use localhost recording + mention "deploying post-recording"
- Have screenshots as fallback for each step
