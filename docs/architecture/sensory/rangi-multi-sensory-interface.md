# Rangi Multi-Sensory Interface (RMI)
_The UX Layer for Harmonically-Driven Applications_

The Rangi Multi-Sensory Interface (RMI) is a design and UI/UX framework
that standardizes how applications present harmonic information to users.

RMI defines:
- how dashboards glow,
- how charts breathe,
- how colors map to harmonic states,
- how animations mirror market rhythm.

## 1. RMI Components

### A. Harmonic Visual Layer (HVL)
Includes:
- waveforms  
- torus/bloch animations  
- harmonic fields  
- color gradients  
- rhythmic particle flows  

### B. Haptic Feedback Layer (HFL)
Defines:
- pulse frequency  
- vibration texture  
- pattern sequences  

### C. Audio Scene Layer (ASL)
Defines:
- soundscape  
- tonal palette  
- thematic mapping

## 2. Harmonic Color Model (HCM)

Colors map to:
- liquidity  
- stress  
- opportunity  
- risk  
- stability  

Examples:
- Deep Blue = equilibrium  
- Yellow = mild opportunity  
- Orange = rising volatility  
- Red = extreme stress

## 3. Harmonic Motion Model (HMM)

Visual motion follows:
- rhythmic pulse  
- volatility-induced turbulence  
- liquidity “waves”  
- mempool “gravity wells”

## 4. Accessibility Design

RMI supports:
- colorblind modes  
- full sound-off mode  
- vibration-only mode  
- narration mode

## 5. Why RMI Matters

RMI ensures that apps are:
- intuitive  
- beautiful  
- universal  
- data-rich  
- emotionally coherent  

RMI is the **visual + emotional language** of RangisNet.
