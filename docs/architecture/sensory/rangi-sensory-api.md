# Rangi Sensory API (RSA)
_The Unified Interface for Sound, Vibration, Motion, and Visual Harmonics_

The Rangi Sensory API (RSA) is the developer-facing interface that
converts harmonic packets (HEF/SEC/HFP) into sensory outputs across
multiple devices and environments:

- audio engines  
- haptic motors  
- display layers  
- VR/AR environments  
- wearables  

RSA makes the blockchain *perceivable*.

## 1. Purpose of RSA

1. Provide a simple API for any app to “play” harmonic data.  
2. Standardize outputs across:
   - web  
   - mobile  
   - hardware  
   - games  
3. Translate Harmonic Vectors → multi-sensory signals.  
4. Enable inclusive, accessible financial UX for all users.

## 3. RSA Output Channels

### A. Audio Engine
- frequency  
- amplitude  
- timbre  
- rhythm  

### B. Haptic Engine
- intensity  
- pulse rate  
- duration  
- texture (sharp/soft/buzzy)  

### C. Visual Engine
- color maps  
- waveform animations  
- glow patterns  
- harmonic geometry

## 4. RSA Modalities

| Mode | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| Audio | Markets you can hear |
| Haptic | Markets you can feel |
| Visual | Markets you can see |
| Mixed | Human sensory fusion |

## 5. Device Support

RSA supports:
- Web browsers  
- iOS / Android  
- VR/AR headsets  
- Smartwatches  
- Haptic vests  
- Game engines (Unity, Unreal)

## 6. Why RSA Matters

RSA enables:
- accessibility  
- intuition  
- immersion  
- emotional connection  
- faster responses  
- reduced mental load  

RSA is the **gateway** that turns data → sensation.
