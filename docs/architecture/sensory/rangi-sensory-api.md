# Rangi Sensory API (RSA)
_The Unified Interface for Sound, Vibration, Motion, and Visual Harmonics_

The Rangi Sensory API (RSA) is the developer-facing interface that
converts harmonic packets (HEF/SEC/HFP) into sensory outputs across
multiple devices and environments:

- audio engines  
- haptic motors  
- display layers  
- VR/AR environments  
- wearables  

RSA makes the blockchain *perceivable*.

## 1. Purpose of RSA

1. Provide a simple API for any app to “play” harmonic data.  
2. Standardize outputs across:
   - web  
   - mobile  
   - hardware  
   - games  
3. Translate Harmonic Vectors → multi-sensory signals.  
4. Enable inclusive, accessible financial UX for all users.
