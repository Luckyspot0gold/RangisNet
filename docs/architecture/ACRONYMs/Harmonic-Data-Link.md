# Harmonic Data Link (HDL)
_A Cross-Chain Transport Layer for Harmonic Intelligence_

The Harmonic Data Link (HDL) allows RangisNet harmonic packets (HEF/SEC)
to be transferred across blockchains or between L1/L2 ecosystems.

HDL is designed to:
- move harmonic data efficiently,
- preserve sensory meaning,
- integrate with any ecosystem (AVAX, ETH, SOL, BTC L2s, COSMOS, POLKADOT).
