# Rangi Consensus Pulse (RCP)
_The Global Rhythmic Signal That Coordinates Network Stability_

The Rangi Consensus Pulse (RCP) is an aggregate harmonic signal derived
from all Consensus Harmonic Signals (CHS). It represents the health,
stability, and rhythm of the entire network.

RCP is the “breathing pattern” of the blockchain.

## 1. What Is RCP?

RCP is produced every 1–3 seconds by aggregating:
- validator CHS signals,
- network congestion metrics,
- block timing,
- revert rates,
- node drift.

The result is a single harmonic output:
