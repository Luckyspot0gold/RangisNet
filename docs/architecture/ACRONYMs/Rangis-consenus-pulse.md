# Rangi Consensus Pulse (RCP)
_The Global Rhythmic Signal That Coordinates Network Stability_

The Rangi Consensus Pulse (RCP) is an aggregate harmonic signal derived
from all Consensus Harmonic Signals (CHS). It represents the health,
stability, and rhythm of the entire network.

RCP is the “breathing pattern” of the blockchain.

## 1. What Is RCP?

RCP is produced every 1–3 seconds by aggregating:
- validator CHS signals,
- network congestion metrics,
- block timing,
- revert rates,
- node drift.

The result is a single harmonic output:

## 2. Purpose of RCP

RCP helps:
- nodes determine whether the network is calm or stressed,
- wallets and bots make better tx timing choices,
- bridges synchronize safely,
- developers build multi-sensory dashboards.

## 3. The RCP Harmonic Signature

The harmonic signature consists of:
- global detune (marketwide drift),
- amplitude (stress level),
- timbre (quality of conditions),
- rhythm pattern (finality rhythm).

This signature can be sent as:
- audio,
- haptics,
- visual waveform,
- machine-readable signal.

## 4. RCP Threshold States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Low Pulse | Network stable |
| Elevated | Mild volatility |
| High Pulse | Congestion rising |
| Chaotic | Bridge danger, extremal risk |

## 5. RCP and Gas Efficiency

RCP allows:
- automatic avoidance of unstable blocks,
- load balancing,
- congestion-smoothed submissions.

The pulse tells participants *when to act*.

RCP is the **macro heartbeat of the chain.**
