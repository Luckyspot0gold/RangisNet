# Rangi Node Pulse (RNP)
_The Individual Heartbeat of Each Validator and Full Node_

The Rangi Node Pulse (RNP) is a per-node harmonic signal representing the
local state of a specific validator or full node.

Unlike CHS or RPS, RNP is **individual**, not collective.

## 2. Harmonic Stress Indicator

Derived from:
- resource load,
- local latency,
- packet loss,
- backlog of work.

When harmonic_stress increases, the node produces:
- higher amplitude pulse,
- distorted timbre.

Bots and network managers can automatically:
- re-route traffic,
- adjust load balancing,
- remove unhealthy validators temporarily.

## 3. Node-Level Sonification

Humans can “hear” a node’s health:
- smooth hum = good  
- jittery rumble = warning  
- harsh distortion = danger  

This is powerful for operators running multiple nodes.

## 4. Interaction With Higher Layers

RNP feeds into:
- Reality Pulse Sync (RPS)
- Consensus Harmonic Signals (CHS)
- Rangi Consensus Pulse (RCP)

RNP is the **micro-heartbeat** of each node.
