# Harmonic Sonification Matrix (HSM)
_The Mapping Layer from Numeric State → Harmonic State_

The Harmonic Sonification Matrix (HSM) defines how quantitative data
transforms into harmonic attributes.

This is the “bridge” between analytics and sensation.

## 1. Goal of the HSM

To convert:
- price movement  
- volatility  
- liquidity  
- congestion  
- validator health  

into:
- frequency  
- amplitude  
- timbre  
- rhythm  

This mapping is **deterministic**, not arbitrary.

## 2. HSM Input Dimensions

Inputs include:
---

## 3. Mapping Functions

### Frequency
### Amplitude
### Timbre
### Rhythm
---

## 4. Outputs
---

## 5. Why HSM Matters

It ensures:
- harmonic outputs are consistent  
- multi-sensory signals match underlying truth  
- different chains produce comparable harmonics  

HSM is the **mathematical soul** of RangisNet.
