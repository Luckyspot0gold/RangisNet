# Harmonic Sonification Matrix (HSM)
_The Mapping Layer from Numeric State → Harmonic State_

The Harmonic Sonification Matrix (HSM) defines how quantitative data
transforms into harmonic attributes.

This is the “bridge” between analytics and sensation.

## 1. Goal of the HSM

To convert:

- timbre  
- rhythm  

This mapping is **deterministic**, not arbitrary.
