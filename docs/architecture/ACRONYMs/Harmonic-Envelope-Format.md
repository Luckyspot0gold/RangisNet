# Harmonic Envelope Format (HEF)
_A Chain-Agnostic Standard for Harmonic Intelligence_

The Harmonic Envelope Format (HEF) is the primary transport format for
harmonic data. It carries both asset state and harmonic fingerprints in a
unified, small, efficient structure.

HEF packets can be:
- written on-chain,
- sent off-chain,
- bridged cross-chain,
- played as audio,
- interpreted by bots.
