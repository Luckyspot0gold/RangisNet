**Subject:** Pilot Opportunity: Accessible, Non-Deceptive Economic Perception (AEAS)

---

Hello [Name],

I'm reaching out to invite your organization to consider a limited pilot evaluating a new accessibility standard for economic interfaces: the **ADA Economic Accessibility Standard (AEAS)**.

AEAS defines requirements for representing economic state through multiple sensory modalities (audio, haptic, spatial) without prediction or persuasion, with a focus on effective communication for blind/low-vision users, Deaf/HoH users, neurodivergent users, seniors, and individuals under cognitive load.

We've published AEAS v1.x as a draft for comment and built a small reference implementation (Rangi's Net) to support evaluation. The system:

- Does not provide trading advice or predictions
- Focuses solely on perceiving current economic state
- Is aligned with ADA/Section 508 concepts via an explicit mapping annex

## Pilot scope (suggested):

- Short evaluation period (2–6 weeks)
- Defined use case (education, accessibility research, simulation)
- Qualitative and quantitative feedback on comprehension, stress, and usability
- No production deployment or financial risk

**The goal is independent feedback—not endorsement.**

If this aligns with your research or accessibility mandate, I'd welcome a short conversation to discuss scope and safeguards.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
