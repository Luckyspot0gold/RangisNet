## AEAS v1.x Published for Public Review; Rangi's Net Demonstrates Multi-Sensory Economic Accessibility

William McCrea today announced the publication of AEAS v1.x (ADA Economic Accessibility Standard), a draft technical and ethical standard designed to make economic systems perceivable through multiple sensory channels—audio, haptic, and spatial—without prediction, persuasion, or manipulation.

AEAS addresses a long-standing accessibility gap in economic interfaces that rely almost exclusively on visual abstraction (charts, dashboards, text). The standard defines requirements for non-deceptive translation, user choice, multi-modal parity, and auditability, with the goal of enabling effective communication for blind and low-vision users, Deaf and hard-of-hearing users, neurodivergent users, seniors, and individuals experiencing cognitive overload.

Alongside the standard, Rangi's Net is released as a reference implementation demonstrating how AEAS principles can be applied in practice. Rangi's Net is not a trading system and does not provide predictions or advice. It represents current economic state through sensory mappings designed to preserve informational integrity and user agency.

AEAS v1.x is published as a draft for comment. Researchers, accessibility practitioners, engineers, regulators, and the public are invited to review, test, and provide feedback.

## What this is

- A draft standard for accessible, non-deceptive economic perception
- A framework aligned with U.S. accessibility law (ADA, Section 508) via Annex US-1
- A reference implementation to support evaluation and discussion

## What this is not

- Not a prediction engine
- Not a trading platform
- Not financial advice
- Not an exclusive or proprietary standard
