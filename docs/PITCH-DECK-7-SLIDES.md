## SLIDE 1: TITLE / HOOK
**Visual:** RangisNet logo on black, 432Hz waveform pulsing

### Text:
```
🌈 RangisNet Mighty Agent
Feel Before Send

Patent-Protected Harmonic Economic Interpreter
Built on Avalanche • Powered by x402

Team: [Your Name/Team]
Hack2Build x402 - December 2025
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Imagine if your body could feel market confidence—no charts, no stress. That's RangisNet."

---

## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM
**Visual:** Split image - professional trader vs. frustrated average user

### Key Points:
```
❌ 2 Billion People Can't Trade Crypto

Why?
• Charts = cognitive overload
• Risk = abstract concept
• Trust = missing intuition
• Complexity = barrier to entry

Result: 90% give up within 30 days
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Trading is sensory for pros—they *feel* patterns. For 2 billion others, it's just noise. We're fixing that."

---

## SLIDE 3: THE SOLUTION
**Visual:** Patent document + equation + phone vibrating

### Key Points:
```
✅ RangisNet Mighty Agent
Market Data → Body Intuition

Patent (Aug 2025): Crypto Clashers
H(t) = A(t) * sin(2π * 432Hz * t + φ)

Converts:
📊 PRM Score → 🤳 Haptic Pattern → 💰 Agentic Payment

92% confidence = Triple pulse |||
65% confidence = Gentle buzz ~~~
45% confidence = Warning ~!~!~

You don't think. You FEEL.
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our patent converts market harmonics into tactile cognition. Your body knows before your brain—no PhD required."

---

## SLIDE 4: DEMO (VIDEO EMBED)
**Visual:** Embedded 60-90 second demo video (if allowed) OR key screenshots

### Flow (if static):
```
1. Connect → Thirdweb one-tap wallet
2. Evaluate → Polly agent: "Buy AVAX? PRM: 92%"
3. Feel → Phone pulses (|||) - High confidence!
4. Pay → x402 micropayment: $0.01 USDC
5. Warp → ICM teleporter to RangisNet Subnet
6. Done → Trade executed in <8 seconds

Gas: 0.000001 RANGI
Accuracy: 99% (backtest)
Latency: <8s total, <50ms haptic
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Watch a real trade. [Play video OR walk through screenshots.] 60 seconds. One tap. Zero stress. Your body just understood a 92% confidence score."

## SLIDE 7: VISION & ASK
**Visual:** Global map with RangisNet nodes lighting up, Avalanche Hub logo

### The Vision:
```
🌍 The Felt Economy

Target Markets:
• 2B unbanked/underbanked (Southeast Asia, Africa)
• 1.5B accessibility-first users (haptic-native)
• 500M mobile-first traders (no desktop needed)
• 100M+ AI agents (autonomous DeFi)

Total Addressable Market: $4T in dormant capital

Outcome:
Web3 becomes intuitive, not intellectual.
Agents negotiate. Humans feel. Everyone wins.
```

### The Ask:
```
🎯 Avalanche Hub Integration

Request:
1. Standard for agentic x402 payments
2. RangisNet subnet as reference implementation
3. Patent licensing for Hub ecosystem
4. Post-hack grant (InfraBuild(AI) $50K-$250K)

Next 6 Months:
• Mainnet launch (Q1 2026)
• 10K users (mobile-first)
• 5 partner dApps (integrate haptics)
• CyreneAI funding round (seed/growth)

Long-term:
The "Venmo of Web3" for 2B users.
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"RangisNet isn't just a hack project—it's the foundation for the felt economy. We're asking Avalanche Hub to make our patent-protected harmonic rails the *standard* for agent payments. With your support, we'll onboard the next billion users—not through education, but through *intuition*."

## ALTERNATIVE: 3-SLIDE "LIGHTNING" VERSION

If forced to ultra-compress:

### Slide 1: Problem → Solution
- Left: 2B can't trade (charts = noise)
- Right: RangisNet = body intuition (patent)

### Slide 2: Demo + Architecture
- Top: 60s demo screenshots
- Bottom: Tech stack (7 layers compressed)

### Slide 3: Traction + Ask
