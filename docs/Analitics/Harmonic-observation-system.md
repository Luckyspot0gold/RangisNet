# Harmonic Observation System (HOS)
_Real-Time Monitoring of Harmonic and Market Dynamics_

The Harmonic Observation System (HOS) continuously monitors market,
network, and cross-chain conditions and evaluates them through the
harmonic lens.

HOS is the “sensing organ” of RangisNet.

## 1. Responsibilities

HOS tracks:
- volatility bursts  
- liquidity drain  
- mempool surges  
- validator drift  
- harmonic drift  
- bridge instability  
- static vs dynamic market shifts  

HOS feeds:
- SEC  
- HEF  
- HPT  
- HST  
- RCP  
- MQMS

## 2. HOS Components

### 2.1 Data Aggregator
Collects data from:
- RPC nodes  
- indexers  
- data providers  
- bridges  
- validators  

### 2.2 Harmonic Analyzer
Applies:
- HSM (Harmonic Sonification Matrix)  
- M3 metrics  
- MQMS transforms  

### 2.3 Threshold Evaluator
Checks:
- HPT  
- HST  

### 2.4 Event Trigger Engine
Fires:
- Sonic Event Codes  
- Alerts  
- Vibrations  
- Visual overlays

## 3. HOS Timeline

Every 50–250 ms:
- map state  
- recalc harmonic attributes  
- detect anomalies  
- update harmonic vectors  
- update global pulses (RCP)

## 4. Why HOS Matters

Without HOS:
- sonification would lag  
- instability would surprise users  
- no real-time optimization  
- no early-warning capability  

HOS is the **eyes and ears** of RangisNet.
