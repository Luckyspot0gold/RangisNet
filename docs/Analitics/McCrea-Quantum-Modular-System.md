# McCrea Quantum Modular System (MQMS)
_The Quantum-Harmonic Brain of RangisNet_

## Overview
MQMS is the central analytic engine that transforms raw market data into harmonic intelligence using quantum-inspired mathematics and multi-dimensional state analysis.

## Core Architecture

### Quantum State Processing
```python
class QuantumHarmonicProcessor:
    def __init__(self):
        self.wave_functions = {}      # Asset probability waves
        self.entanglement_graph = {}  # Cross-asset correlations
        self.harmonic_operators = {}  # Frequency domain transforms
        
    def process_market_state(self, raw_data):
        # Convert to quantum probability amplitudes
        psi = self.quantum_encode(raw_data)
        
        # Apply harmonic transforms
        harmonic_state = self.harmonic_operator(psi)
        
        # Generate multi-sensory outputs
        return self.sonify(harmonic_state)

_The Cognitive Engine That Powers Harmonic Intelligence_

The McCrea Quantum Modular System (MQMS) is the analytical foundation of
RangisNet. It applies quantum-inspired transforms and modular reasoning
to extract patterns, predict risks, and generate harmonic outputs that
reflect deeper truths within the data.

MQMS is where:
- physics-inspired math,
- financial analytics,
- signal processing,
- and harmonic mapping  

all converge.

## 1. Purpose of MQMS

MQMS performs three tasks:

1. **Interpretation**  
   Convert market/network data into meaningful vectors.

2. **Prediction**  
   Forecast congestion, volatility, or trend shifts before they manifest.

3. **Harmonic Mapping**  
   Convert insights into harmonic fingerprints and sensory cues.

MQMS is the *cognitive center* of Rangi’s ecosystem.

## 2. MQMS Architecture

MQMS is composed of four modules:

### A. Quantum State Mapper (QSM)
Takes raw data and converts it into quasi-quantum state vectors using:

- normalization  
- embedding  
- dimensional folding  
- phasor transformations
