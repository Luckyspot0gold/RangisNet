# Rangi Load Analyzer (RLA)
_Predicting Network Congestion Before It Happens_

The Rangi Load Analyzer (RLA) is a predictive processor that forecasts
network congestion 1–10 blocks into the future.

This allows users and bots to:
- avoid bad timing windows,
- reduce wasted gas,
- reduce transaction retries,
- improve confirmation speed.

## 1. Inputs

RLA consumes:
- mempool load  
- gas price  
- tx arrival rates  
- block fill ratios  
- recent revert rates  
- validator CHS signals  

---

## 2. Prediction Engine

RLA uses:
- smoothing filters  
- short-term trends  
- harmonic drift analysis  
- machine learning 
- congestion wave modeling

## 4. Integration Points

RLA feeds:
- SEC generation (congestion warnings)
- HPT (danger)
- HST (opportunity)
- wallet UX
- bot API logic
- bridge health checks

## 5. Why RLA Matters

RLA turns congestion from a **reaction** into a **prediction**.

This reduces:
- gas waste,
- latency,
- user frustration,
- risk of lost assets.

RLA is the **predictive engine** behind RangisNet’s efficiency gains.
