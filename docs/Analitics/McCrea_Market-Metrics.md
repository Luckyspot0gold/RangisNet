# McCrea Market Metrics (M3)
_The Proprietary Indicators That Drive Harmonic Intelligence_

The McCrea Market Metrics (M3) suite is a set of proprietary indicators
designed to quantify market conditions in a way that is directly useful
for harmonic sonification.

The main indicators are:

- **HVI — Harmonic Volatility Index**  
- **HLI — Harmonic Liquidity Index**  
- **HSI — Harmonic Stability Index**

These form the backbone of the Harmonic Fingerprint (HFP).

## 1. Harmonic Volatility Index (HVI)

HVI quantifies how volatile the market “feels,” not just statistical sigma.

Inputs:
- realized volatility  
- implied volatility  
- price oscillations  
- rhythm irregularity  

Formula (conceptual):
Output: `0 → 1`  
- 0 = calm  
- 1 = chaotic  

Mapped to:
- detune ratio  
- amplitude

## 2. Harmonic Liquidity Index (HLI)

HLI measures the “fullness” or “emptiness” of the market.

Inputs:
- order book depth  
- slippage risk  
- cross-exchange liquidity  
- pool health
- Output: `0 → 1`  
- low → hollow timbre  
- high → rich timbre

## 3. Harmonic Stability Index (HSI)

HSI measures the probability that:
- trades go through,
- blocks finalize quickly,
- conditions remain calm.

Inputs:
- volatility  
- liquidity  
- mempool load  
- validator sync  
- revert rate  

Formula:
Output: `0 → 1`  
- high → green-light window  
- low → red-light warning

## 4. Why M3 Matters

M3 transforms raw data into:
- musical intuition,  
- harmonic fingerprints,  
- user-protective warnings.

M3 is the **metric engine** of RangisNet’s sensory universe.
