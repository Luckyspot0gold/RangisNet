## What Changed

The AEAS Literature Review has been expanded from v1.0 (40+ citations) to **v2.0 (48+ citations)** with contributions from Grok AI. The new version is more comprehensive, better organized by AEAS chapter alignment, and includes institutional sources alongside peer-reviewed research.

---

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Reorganized by AEAS Chapter Relevance**
Each section now explicitly maps to the AEAS v1.1 chapters it supports:
- Section 1 → Chapters 3, 6 (Sensory Domains, Visual/Spatial Cognition)
- Section 2 → Chapter 5 (Haptic Economic Cognition)
- Section 3 → Chapter 4 (Auditory Economic Cognition)
- Section 4 → Chapter 2 (Accessibility Requirement)
- Section 5 → Chapter 7 (Olfactory Domain)
- Section 6 → Chapter 9 (Human–AI Interfaces)
- Section 7 → Chapter 10 (Simulation & Training / EcoVerse)
- Section 8 → Chapters 11, 14 (Compliance, Longevity)

### 2. **Expanded Citation Coverage**
- **Multi-Sensory Data Visualization in Finance**: 10 citations (NEW - industry + academic)
- **Haptic Feedback for Economic Decision-Making**: 10 citations (expanded from 4)
- **Auditory Sonification of Financial Data**: 9 citations (expanded from 3, includes MarketBuzz, sMAX)
- **Accessibility in Economic Systems**: 9 citations (NEW - World Economic Forum, Federal Reserve, etc.)
- **Olfactory Interfaces in HCI**: 5 citations (expanded from 1)
- **Human-AI Interfaces in Finance**: 5 citations (NEW - supports "Is Mandate")
- **Simulation Environments for Training**: 5 citations (NEW - supports EcoVerse)
- **Long-Term Standards for Accessibility**: 5 citations (NEW - government/institutional)

### 3. **Institutional Sources Added**
The review now includes citations from:
- World Economic Forum
- Federal Reserve Board
- NASCIO (government technology)
- Harvard Business Publishing
- MIT Media Lab
- BBC (public broadcasting validation of sonification)
- State government accessibility standards (Mass.gov)

### 4. **Complete APA Bibliography**
All 48 sources are now formatted in full APA style, alphabetized, with proper retrieval information.

### 5. **Enhanced "Summary and Implications" Section**
New section explicitly states:
- How each citation set validates AEAS domains
- Research gaps AEAS uniquely addresses (integration across modalities, non-deceptive design, universal accessibility, privacy-first AI)
- Next steps for academic validation (peer review targets, university partnerships, empirical studies)
- Industry adoption pathways (Federal Reserve, Bloomberg/Reuters, retail brokerages)

1. **Janata & Childs (2004)**: MarketBuzz sonification of real-time financial data
2. **Ciardi (2004)**: sMAX toolkit for stock market sonification
3. **Hermann (2005)**: Sonification for exploratory data analysis (PhD thesis)

### Haptic Economic Decision-Making (Validates Tactile Domain)

2. **Lee et al. (2025)**: Mobile vibrations evoke reward responses
3. **Vazquez et al. (2021)**: Haptic-payment nudges reduce spending

### Accessibility Imperative (Validates "Accessibility as Core Requirement")
1. **World Economic Forum (2018)**: Closing accessibility gap in financial services
2. **Federal Reserve Board (2021)**: Accessibility policy for financial systems
3. **Banks et al. (2024)**: Financial inclusion for people with disabilities in *The Lancet Global Health*

## What This Means for AEAS

### Academic Credibility
With 48 citations spanning neuroscience, HCI, economics, finance, and accessibility research, AEAS now has the scholarly foundation to:
- Submit to peer-reviewed journals (*ACM Transactions on Accessible Computing*, *Universal Access in the Information Society*)
- Apply for research grants (NSF, NIH accessibility grants)
- Partner with universities (MIT Media Lab, Stanford HAI, CMU HCI Institute)

### Regulatory Validation
Citations from the Federal Reserve, World Economic Forum, and government accessibility standards position AEAS as aligned with institutional mandates for financial accessibility.

### Industry Adoption
References to existing financial sonification tools (MarketBuzz, sMAX) and accessibility initiatives at major financial institutions create precedent for AEAS implementation.

### Competitive Positioning
The literature review demonstrates that while individual components of AEAS exist in research (sonification, haptic feedback, accessible design), **no existing standard integrates them with mathematical rigor (entropy preservation, reversibility) and ethical constraints ("Is Mandate", uncertainty resonance)**.
