### Scene 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:20)

**(Visual: Fast-paced montage of confusing charts, flashing numbers, and stressed traders. Sound of chaotic market noise.)**

**Narrator (Justin):**
"The world of crypto is complex, noisy, and overwhelming. How can you make confident decisions when you're drowning in data? How can we make DeFi accessible to everyone, including the 2 billion people with visual impairments?"

**(Visual: Screen focuses on a single, clear question: "What if you could *feel* the market?")**

---

### Scene 2: Introducing RangisNet (0:20 - 0:50)

**(Visual: Smooth transition to the clean, elegant RangisNet logo. Sound of a single, clear 432 Hz tone.)**

**Narrator (Justin):**
"Introducing RangisNet, the world's first multi-sensory AI trading agent. We turn market chaos into clear, intuitive sensory feedback."

**(Visual: Animation showing market data (RSI, VIX, etc.) flowing into the PTE Engine. The engine outputs a single PRM value and a clear recommendation: SEND, WAIT, or REJECT.)**

**Narrator (Justin):**
"Our Probability Tensor Engine analyzes millions of data points in sub-microseconds, generating a single Probability Resonance Metric—a confidence score from 0 to 1."

**(Visual: The PRM value is mapped to a harmonic tone, a haptic vibration, and a phonic waveform.)**

**Narrator (Justin):**
"High confidence? You hear a clear, high-frequency tone and feel a strong pulse. Low confidence? You hear a dissonant tone and feel a warning buzz. You don't just see the market—you *feel* it."

### Scene 3: Live Demo - Manual Mode (0:50 - 1:30)

**(Visual: Screen recording of a user interacting with Claude Desktop.)**

**User (On-screen text):**
`Analyze the AVAX/USD market. RSI is 35, VIX is high at 45, sentiment is bearish.`

**(Visual: Claude calls the `analyze_market` tool. The result shows a low PRM of 0.21 and a REJECT recommendation.)**

**(Sound: A low, dissonant 600 Hz tone plays. Visual: A phone on the desk vibrates with a buzzing pattern. A red "REJECT" notification appears.)**

**Narrator (Justin):**
"Here, the market is unfavorable. RangisNet gives a clear 'REJECT' signal. You instantly know to stay away."

**(Visual: New prompt in Claude.)**

**User (On-screen text):**
`Analyze again. RSI is now 72, VIX is stable at 18, sentiment is bullish.`

**(Visual: Claude calls the tool again. The result shows a high PRM of 0.85 and a SEND recommendation.)**

**(Sound: A clear, high-frequency 1280 Hz tone plays. Visual: The phone vibrates with a strong, confident pulse. A green "SEND" notification appears.)**

**Narrator (Justin):**
"Now, conditions are perfect. RangisNet gives a confident 'SEND' signal. You can act with certainty."

### Scene 4: Live Demo - Autonomous Mode (1:30 - 2:00)

**(Visual: The user enables "Auto Execute" in the RangisNet Chrome Extension popup.)**

**Narrator (Justin):**
"But what if the agent could act for you? Introducing RangisNet BrowserMCP. Our AI agent can now autonomously execute trades through your own browser, using your logged-in wallets."

**(Visual: New prompt in Claude.)**

**User (On-screen text):**
`Monitor AVAX/USD. When PRM is above 0.8, buy $50 of AVAX using my MetaMask wallet.`

**(Visual: The agent monitors the market. The PRM value on screen climbs to 0.82. The green "SEND" notification appears, followed by a confirmation dialog.)**

**(Sound: Confident tone and pulse.)**

**(Visual: The user clicks "Confirm". The MetaMask extension pops up, the transaction is signed, and a success notification appears from Etherscan/Snowtrace.)**

**Narrator (Justin):**
"The agent detected the perfect moment, triggered the sensory feedback, and executed the trade—all in under a second. It's fast, private, and secure because it all happens locally on your machine."

### Scene 5: The Vision & Impact (2:00 - 2:30)

**(Visual: Montage of diverse users—including visually impaired individuals—using RangisNet on phones and desktops, feeling confident and in control. Animation showing Avalanche x402 micropayments powering the sensory feedback.)**

**Narrator (Justin):**
"RangisNet is more than a trading bot. It's an accessibility revolution. It's a new standard for human-AI interaction, built on Avalanche.

With a 14.5 million transaction-per-second engine and native x402 micropayment integration, RangisNet is ready to scale to the entire Avalanche ecosystem and beyond."
